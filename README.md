# STL_Map

## Introduction:

+ This was my revision about Map_ An useful library in STL C++ after learning the course of Advanced programming at my university.

+ Map is actually a well-supported library with its availably written function: Insert, count, find, erase, size.

## Usage:

+ Every element of a map has two components: key-value. Every key in a map is distinguished and arranged. 

+ It is actually helpful in a problem requiring counting the occurences of an element in an array.

+ Multimap is similar to map, but it can help us to save the same key.

## Conclusion:

+ Using Map actually enhances our coding performances when it comes to improving the complexity of algorithm.
